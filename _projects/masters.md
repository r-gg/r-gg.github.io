## Abstract

The project firstly evaluates model performance with non-iid data in different training settings: *syncrhonous*, *asynchronous* and *online*. This extensive experimentation shows that model performance is significantly degraded when asynchronous aggregation strategy is used. To address this, an adaptive strategy will be developed that is going to leverage a reinforcement learning agent for weighing the clients.

Implementation will be based on the [flower](https://flower.ai/) framework. It will be extended to support asynchronous and online (streaming data) federated learning.

Approximated end date: **July 2024**
