## Udemy Courses Business Data Analytics

### Scenario

Udemy aims to identify the key characteristics of the most popular IT courses, such as popular titles, average rating, rating count, and price, that appeal to its customers to improve the course portfolio and enhance student retention. Course creators are interested in the potential revenue of their course. Thus, we want to predict the number of subscribers to be able to estimate revenues.

### Business Objectives

The following business objectives will be considered:
1. Identifying key features of popular courses: The characteristics and features of courses that are highly rated and have a large number of subscribers shall be analysed so that strategies for improving student retention can be developed. This way Udemy can improve itâ€™s course portfolio and increase customer satisfaction
2. Analyzing the profit and course content (based on title) and extracting patterns that can be monetized
3. Analyzing the most common terms in course titles
4. Identifying the most popular courses and analyzing their prices and published time
5. Analyzing the distributions of several important attributes (average rating, number of subscribers) and detecting patterns
6. Number of subscribers prediction: Build a model that can predict the number of subscribers for a given course which can then later be used to estimate the sales profit for courses
