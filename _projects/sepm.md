## Description

The software includes a transparent **communication** channel **between property management companies** and their **residents** and **flat owners**. The aim is to provide information about current and upcoming events, for example. This information covers, for example, repair and service work, such as the bleeding of radiators by a heating technician, as well as chimney cleaning by a chimney sweep.

Residents can also use a **booking system** to book facilities such as a fitness room, sauna or laundry room, if available. For services that are not included in the rent, such as the use of the laundry room, it is possible for residents to top up **credit** in advance to cover the costs of running the washing machines or other services. 

Residents or flat owners receive one account per household or, if the flat is sublet, the flat owners also receive their own personal account. All tenants will then be able to view personal information about their **rent** and **operating costs** as well as the **rental agreement** online and download it as a **PDF** from their private accounts.

A property manager can add, remove and edit new properties. It is responsible for creating appointments and adding new residents or flat owners to a property.

The main purpose of the system is to facilitate communication between property managers and residents so that future surprise visits and a confusing paper trail on the notice board can be avoided.
