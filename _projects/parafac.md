## Description

Under Professor Filzmoser's guidance, I authored analytical code for a statistical data analysis of economic growth factors. Results of this project were published as a part of a [research paper](https://ph.pollub.pl/index.php/preko/article/view/3941). The primary goal of the project was presenting complex multi-dimensional time-series data transparently, concisely and oriented toward a specific goal. Appropriate visualization enabled acquiring insights presented in the paper and facilitated data exploration/interpretation. 

As the primary analysis techniques **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC)** were leveraged and implemented in **R** programming language.

The following plot illustrates the general structure of the project's results.

    Plot of the scores (a) and loadings (b) of the first two Principal Components. For each country a line is plotted to represent the temporal development of this country. Based on the loading vector, it is visible how the countries progress over time with respect to the main loading variables.
