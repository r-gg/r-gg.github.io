While doing research for the Performance isolation paper, I was inspired to make a tool for visualizing references between the research papers. After implementing the first prototype I found out there are already plenty of advanced commercial solutions supporting this. ðŸ˜… 

To achieve this, I implemented a ResearchGate scraper that would take a list of papers and build a **set** of their citation-relationships as well as extend these with citations up to depth *d*. These relationships were then visualized in form of an interactive undirected [graph](https://r-gg.github.io/assets/html/graph.html). 

> Code available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/r-gg/connect-papers/).

> A demo of the resulting graph is available [here](https://r-gg.github.io/assets/html/graph.html).


Here is also a screenshot of the references graph:
